# The Compiler Code of Conduct

_This policy is a "living" document, and subject to refinement and expansion in the future._

The Compiler is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neurotype, physical appearance, body, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, language, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

This code of conduct applies to all The Compiler-sponsored spaces, including our [website](https://thecompilter.site), [open-source projects](https://github.com/onthecompiler), and other spaces that The Compiler hosts, both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the The Compiler team.

Some The Compiler-sponsored spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.

## Diversity Statement

The Compiler welcomes and encourages participation by everyone.

No matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you. We welcome contributions from everyone as long as they interact constructively with our communities.
